# Lorainne
Lorainne is currently in early beta testing and is one of theÂ best open-source overall utility overlay available for Hypixel that works on any of your favorite clients. Lorainne is currently only available for migrated accounts.

Installation Process:

2. Go Into the Cloned Repository: `cd Lorainne`
3. Download Dependencies:

`npm install minecraft-protocol`

4. Edit Values of Variables Inside Script (filename: lorainne.js):

`var username = "<Name of Your Minecraft Username>"`
<br>
`var usr = "<Email for Your Minecraft>"`
<br>
`const hclient = new HypixelAPI("")`
(You can get your Hypixel API key by using `/api new` on Hypixel!)

5. Run the script using `node lorainne.js`
6. You can now join Hypixel through `localhost:25567`
