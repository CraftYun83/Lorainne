Lorainne is currently in early beta testing and is one of theÂ best open-source overall utility overlay available for Hypixel that works on any of your favorite clients. Lorainne is currently only available for migrated accounts.

Installation Process:

1. Clone the Repository: `https://github.com/CraftYun83/Lorainne.git`
2. Go Into the Cloned Repository: `cd Lorainne`
3. Download Dependencies:

`npm install minecraft-protocol`

4. Run the script using `node lorainne.js`
5. Edit the generated `config.json` file with the required values
6. Run the script again using `node lorainne.js`
7. You can now join Hypixel through `localhost`
(This is only for the default port (25565) inside `config.json`, if you changed it, join using `localhost:<port_number>`)

Use with caution, anything could happen. Try not starting a winstreak while using Lorainne, you might get kicked without warning!

<h1>Temporarily Discontinued.</h1>
I only started Lorainne because I thought it might've been an interesting project to work on, and also because I do not like close-sourced projects, but school work is a bigger priority. Therefore, I will be temporarily discontinuing the Lorainne project. I will probably be back working on this project in a few weeks. If you have any questions, or whether you have questions about my code, feel free to add me on discord @ FourMC#1822.
